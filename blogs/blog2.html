          <h3>Hi,</h3>
          <p class="font-italic">
          While I was searching for opensource software for finding bugs I found Cabot application. Cabot is a free, open-source, self-hosted infrastructure monitoring platform that provides some of the best features of PagerDuty, Server Density, Pingdom and Nagios without their cost and complexity.It provides a web interface that allows you to monitor services and send telephone, sms or hipchat/email alerts to your on-duty team if those services start misbehaving or go down - all without writing a line of code.<br>After installing it i used each functionality for few hours and came to know about how to use them<br><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/NlGLQ1FU9mVDsMjeIU" width="200" height="200" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></p><p class="font-italic">Then I tried a simple XSS payloads to ensure the security and suddenly got surprised with finding of a cross site scripting vulnerability i was curios because it storing my payload so i check it again and run it to confirm the bug<br>Yeah I got it.. got a stored Cross-site Scripting Vulnerability which is persistant and affects every users including admin users.<br>So i have submitted it to CVE MITRE it took a long time to assign CVE for this bug in CVE id CVE-2020-25449<br>But I dont want to stop my findings there i need to do more impact<br><img src="blog2/impact.png" width="200" height="200" frameBorder="0"><br>there is another thing what i didnt used that is creating new services yes lets do it. I created a Service then choose admin account in users to notify and in URL append a gibberish word to create error (I used just XSS ;) ) now open admin account we can see the notification there running the check Stored XSS Triggered.That was really cool now i thought why i didnt used Blind XSS there HAHA.. I fire up my <a href="https://xsshunter.com/">XSS HUNTER</a>copied the payload and do the same again instead of using Simple XSS payload i used Blind XSS payload now go to  admin account and run it Nothing happened in the screen but when i go to my XSShunter there is the admin cookie and i got the mail from XSShunter that Blind XSS triggered.Lol i was surprised Creating an instances in any normal account and creating a alert service to any account including Django Administrator account can be takeover without a popup of XSS.From user account to Django Administrator account i was like<br> <img src="blog2/hackerman.jpg" width="200" height="200" frameBorder="0"><br>Now time to report<br><br><h2>CVE-2020-25449</h2><b>Affected component</b> : New HTTP check Section<br><br></p><p class="font-italic"> <b>Attack vector</b> :<br>
